This program is the embryo of a Forth interpreter, intended for the
use in a Unix-like environment together with libraries with a C
interface.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory, in the *.rst
files. It is written in the ReStructuredText format, for the Sphinx
documentation system, but should be readable even without it. For the
generation of HTML or PDF files Sphinx v1.0.8 (or later) is needed.

If Sphinx is installed, type "make html" or "make latexpdf" from the
main directory or from doc/ to get the documentation.

EDITING

There is a minimal Emacs mode in the support/ directory. To enable it,
follow the instructions in the file support/mind.el.
