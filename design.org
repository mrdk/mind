*Design decisions*
* C Code
*** Use C99 to full extent.
*** Use gcc specific extensions only when necessary.
    Currently used:
    - computed goto
    - __alignof
* Forth code
*** Normal Forth words are in lower case.
    This makes it much easier to switch between Forth and other
    applications.
*** "Create"-like words begin with a capital letter.
*** There are no words that handle double integers.
    The C integers are large enough for us. [From GraspForth]
