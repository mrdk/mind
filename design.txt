Design decisions

1. C Code

* Use C99 to full extent.

* Use gcc specific extensions only when necessary.
  Currently used: computed goto, __alignof__.

2. Forth code

* Normal Forth words are in lower case. This makes it much easier to
  switch between Forth and other applications.

* "Create"-like words begin with a capital letter.

* There are no words that handle double integers. The C integers are
  large enough for us. [From GraspForth]
